The code compiles without any issue, and the code is well-documented. However, it does have a little bit of dead code in Form1.cs with some code being commented out. There also seems to be a second form, but there is no way to show it to the user as far as I can tell. It seems that the author deleted a button that showed the form on click.

There is no way to reset the application to the default state. Although there is nothing necessarily wrong with that, I believe a "Clear" button would improve user experience significantly. An exception also occured when I selected the options in the "Numeric Data" groupbox and didn't input anything in the textbox.
