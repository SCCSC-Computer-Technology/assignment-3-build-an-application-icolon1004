I was able to compile code without issue. The author has documented their code well and it is easy to follow. A defect I have found in this author's code is there is only one search button. When I fill out groupBox2  and numeric data group box and then click search numeric data takes precedence and it disregards groupbox2 input. This can be fixed by adding a new search box for each group. When I created my code I used access and had a harder time accessing my data. I will be using SQL from now on after reading your code.
