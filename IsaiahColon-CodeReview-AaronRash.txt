Isaiah Colon code review by Aaron Rash

I see you seperated numeric searches from text searches. So did I! But there are some fixable issues with the way you have it set up. 

Since you have two different groupboxes, but only one search button, you need to distinguish which groupbox is being searched.
As it is now, your search button calls 2 methods (FilterData & FilterNumericData). So if you have values in both groupboxes, it will perform the FilterData method first, and then immediately replace the resutls with the FilterNumericData results.
	There are a couple ways to fix this, but the method I chose was to have a search button in each group. You could also add a way to pick a groupbox before calling the associated method, or combine the goups/methods perhaps, whatever you prefer.

Also, adding a 'clear' or 'reset' button would go a long way

There are a dozen duplicate data sets. I totally get it, I did the same exact thing when I was learning how to use these. Just be sure to get of redundant data next time around.

Your code is very organized and well commented, which I really like. Big thumbs up from me.
